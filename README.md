# 30daysleaderboard

I made this for the program #30DaysofGoogleCloud

For this you need to edit all the Qwiklabs Public URL  in the userurl.txt and run main.py
It has multi threading support and it scrapes the data in 6 seconds
For hosting use netlify

Note - Make sure all the Qwiklabs public URL are correct otherwise it will crash.
Also you need to manually scrap and push the data to Github, the netlify will get auto trigger and will update the site in 2 seconds.

Thank You
